Dear reader, 
I am excited to apply for this job opportunity, I am motivated to improve myself and my work to shape projects to the best of my ability. I am currently in my third year a Beng degree at UEA in computer systems engineering. I have completed programming, electronics, network and embedded systems modules in my studies.

During my time at university i have become more and more interested at low level software and hardware development, everything from designing chips to writing code to run on it. I have made a logic based traffic light system, an analogue mircophone encoder and amplifier as well as a knock off "BopIt" game for various couseworks, as well as severl software projects in my free time to further my learning. My thirdyear project is based on an embedded lawnmower robot, similar to "roomba" vacuum. I am currently responsible for the map generation and complete coverage path planning
I enjoy analysing problems and data to understand how to improve performance and efficiency and am relentlessly resilient. I am confident in programming in C++, Python, Java and more.

I look forward to hearing back from you and taking the next step in my career. please find above my contact and project infomation.

Many thanks
Toby Towler
