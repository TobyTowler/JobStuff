I have been intereseted in tehcnology since i was a child. I have built and upgraded my own PC in my free time and trialed various overclocks on it to get the best performance from it. More recently, i have been interested in how to generate the most power from my cars engine, from changing pyhsical components and sensors to rewriting the software/timings of the process. while at uni i have completed elcetronics and embedded systems modules, where i made logic based traffic lights, sound amplifiers and a knock off bop it game using various inputs and outputs across several sensors to a STM32 board.
